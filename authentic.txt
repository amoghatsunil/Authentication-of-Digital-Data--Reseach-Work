The World Health Organisation (WHO) says on its website that while several organizationswere working on developing a vaccine for the Coronavirus, there is as of now, still no vaccination available for the disease.“The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts,” says WHO oits website. Therefore, the best way to protect oneself against the disease is still social distancing and following hygienic practices such as frequently washing hands and covering one’s nose and mouth while sneezing.
The Coronavirus vaccine, if it should become available, will be announced through official platforms such as WHO, Ministry of Heath and so on. Furthermore, people can always turn to PIB Fact Check to get the authenticity of such forwards verified. We would also like to add a word of caution that forwarding unverified and fake information on WhatsApp and other social media platforms could be liable for prosecution during the period of lockdown.
